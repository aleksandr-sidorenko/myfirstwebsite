<h1>Best Hikes in Utah</h1>
<hr>
<p>Utah is home to some of the most stunning terrain in the United States, and some of the highlights are only accessible to those who are willing to lace up their hiking boots and hit the trails. Mountains, deserts, forests, and canyons dominate the landscape, which has been sculpted over the centuries by volcanoes, rivers, glaciers, and earthquakes, leaving behind an amazingly diverse environment. Many of the state's wonders are protected by national and state parks and are open to exploration along countless miles of hiking trails. From the clifftops to the valley floors, you'll find outstanding views, waterfalls, signs of the area's human history, and remnants of another age captured in petrified form, as you explore Utah's best hiking trails.</p>

<h3>1. Delicate Arch, Arches National Park</h3>
<div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicate_Arch"><img style="width: 500px" img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USUT/utah-arches-national-park-best-hikes-in-utah-delicate-arch.jpg"></a>
</div>
<p> One of the most famous and photographed sites in Utah is Delicate Arch, shown on the state license plates. This freestanding iconic arch is unique among the more than 2,000 arches in the park. Rising up from a smooth stone ledge and framing distant mountains on the horizon, the setting here is spectacular. Located in Arches National Park near the town of Moab, this outstanding natural monument can only be reached on a three-mile round-trip hike. The route runs up a gradual rise across open slick rock and is in full sun almost the entire way. As you approach the arch, the trail narrows and follows a ledge around a rock outcrop, and after you turn the final corner, the stunning arch comes into view.</p>
<h3>2. The Narrows, Zion National Park</h3>
<div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Narrows_(Zion_National_Park)"><img style="width: 500px" img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USUT/utah-zion-national-park-best-hikes-in-utah-the-narrows.jpg"></a>
</div>
<p>In a park that is famous for its outstanding hiking trails, The Narrows is one of the most celebrated hikes in Zion National Park. A wet trek up the Virgin River leads through the park's signature feature; a huge slot canyon, known as The Narrows. Hikers literally walk along the river, up the canyon, which in areas is too narrow to have any dry banks. Twisting and curving canyon walls extend up from the river in a dramatic fashion. You can hike from the bottom up The Narrows as far you choose, but many hikers make the 9.4-mile round-trip journey to Big Spring. This is as far as you can go without a permit. Of course, you can always turn around before this point if you want a shorter hike. With a permit, it's also possible to do a 16-mile hike from the top down, beginning at Chamberlain's Ranch, but the number of permits is limited, and this is a big undertaking. Plan on 12 hours hiking. Since this is a river hike, it is also seasonal, opening after the water level moderates following the spring runoff.</p>
<h3>3. Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop Trail, Bryce Canyon National Park</h3>
<div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon_National_Park_Scenic_Trails_Historic_District"><img style="width: 500px" img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USUT/utah-bryce-canyon-national-park-best-hikes-in-utah-queens-garden-navajo-loop.jpg">
</a>
</div>
<p>The Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop Trail is one of the most popular hikes in Bryce Canyon National Park, taking hikers into a world of multihued hoodoos and snaking ridges dotted with pine trees. The hike, which connects the Queen's Garden and Navajo trails, descends from one of the most scenic lookouts, Sunrise Point, into the park's main highlight, the Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. This 2.9-mile loop trail follows a hard-packed path running along winding hill crests at the base of towering hoodoos, to the canyon floor, and back up. The ascent takes you up a steep slope, moderated by a series of switchbacks. If you want to avoid the grind up the switchbacks and opt for a shorter hike, the Queen's Garden trail is a shorter and easier out-and-back hike that takes in some of the main features on the loop trail.</p>
<h3>4. Angel's Landing, Zion National Park</h3>
<div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_Landing"><img style="width: 500px" img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USUT/utah-zion-national-park-best-hikes-in-utah-angels-landing.jpg">
</a>
</div>
<p>Like The Narrows, Angel's Landing is an iconic hiking trail in Zion National Park, but with huge drop-offs and narrow ledges, it's not for everyone. For those fearless souls who are not afraid of heights, this is a bucket-list hike. After a cardio-inducing grind up a series of human engineered switchbacks known as Walter's Wiggles, the trail leads across the ridge of a narrow fin, with sheer cliff walls on either side. Chains, serving as handrails for grasping rather than protective barriers, guide hikers along the trail in some areas. Although outstanding views can be had from all along this trail, the view from the lookout of Angel's Landing is the pinnacle, with a vista out over Zion Canyon like none other in this part of the park. The total distance for this hike is just under 5.5 miles, and the elevation gain is slightly less than 1,500 feet.</p>
